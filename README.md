# Car Dealer App
This is a simple React-based car dealership application, allowing users to view, add, edit, and delete cars. The app includes a search function to filter cars based on make or model and includes a responsive navigation bar.
This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:
