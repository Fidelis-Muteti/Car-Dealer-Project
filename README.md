# Car Dealer App
This is a simple React-based car dealership application, allowing users to view, add, edit, and delete cars. The app includes a search function to filter cars based on make or model and includes a responsive navigation bar.
This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.
Features
View All Cars: Displays a list of available cars, each with a picture, make, model, year, and price.
Add New Cars: A form to add new cars to the database.
Edit Car Details: Update car price and availability.
Delete Cars: Remove cars from the database.
Search Functionality: Search for cars based on make or model.
Responsive Navigation: Simple navigation to access Home, About, and Contact pages.
